48 silly install resolved     readme: 'npm(1) -- a JavaScript package manager\n==============================\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/npm/cli/latest.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/npm/cli)\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\nThis is just enough info to get you up and running.\n\nMuch more info will be available via `npm help` once it\'s installed.\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\n**You need node v6 or higher to run this program.**\n\nTo install an old **and unsupported** version of npm that works on node v5\nand prior, clone the git repo and dig through the old tags and branches.\n\n**npm is configured to use npm, Inc.\'s public package registry at\n<https://registry.npmjs.org> by default.**\n\nYou can configure npm to use any compatible registry you\nlike, and even run your own registry. Check out the [doc on\nregistries](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry).\n\nUse of someone else\'s registry may be governed by terms of use. The\nterms of use for the default public registry are available at\n<https://www.npmjs.com>.\n\n## Super Easy Install\n\nnpm is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\n### Windows Computers\n\n[Get the MSI](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  npm is in it.\n\n### Apple Macintosh Computers\n\n[Get the pkg](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  npm is in it.\n\n### Other Sorts of Unices\n\nRun `make install`.  npm will be installed with node.\n\nIf you want a more fancy pants install (a different version, customized\npaths, etc.) then read on.\n\n## Fancy Install (Unix)\n\nThere\'s a pretty robust install script at\n<https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh>.  You can download that and run it.\n\nHere\'s an example using curl:\n\n```sh\ncurl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Slightly Fancier\n\nYou can set any npm configuration params with that script:\n\n```sh\nnpm_config_prefix=/some/path sh install.sh\n```\n\nOr, you can run it in uber-debuggery mode:\n\n```sh\nnpm_debug=1 sh install.sh\n```\n\n### Even Fancier\n\nGet the code with git.  Use `make` to build the docs and do other stuff.\nIf you plan on hacking on npm, `make link` is your friend.\n\nIf you\'ve got the npm source code, you can also semi-permanently set\narbitrary config keys using the `./configure --key=val ...`, and then\nrun npm commands by doing `node bin/npm-cli.js <command> <args>`.  (This is helpful\nfor testing, or running stuff without actually installing npm itself.)\n\n## Windows Install or Upgrade\n\nMany improvements for Windows users have been made in npm 3 - you will have a better\nexperience if you run a recent version of npm. To upgrade, either use [Microsoft\'s\nupgrade tool](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade),\n[download a new version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),\nor follow the Windows upgrade instructions in the\n[Installing/upgrading npm](https://npm.community/t/installing-upgrading-npm/251/2) post.\n\nIf that\'s not fancy enough for you, then you can fetch the code with\ngit, and mess with it directly.\n\n## Installing on Cygwin\n\nNo.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nSo sad to see you go.\n\n```sh\nsudo npm uninstall npm -g\n```\nOr, if that fails,\n\n```sh\nsudo make uninstall\n```\n\n## More Severe Uninstalling\n\nUsually, the above instructions are sufficient.  That will remove\nnpm, but leave behind anything you\'ve installed.\n\nIf you would like to remove all the packages that you have installed,\nthen you can use the `npm ls` command to find them, and then `npm rm` to\nremove them.\n\nTo remove cruft left behind by npm 0.x, you can use the included\n`clean-old.sh` script file.  You can run it conveniently like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm explore npm -g -- sh scripts/clean-old.sh\n```\n\nnpm uses two configuration files, one for per-user configs, and another\nfor global (every-user) configs.  You can view them by doing:\n\n```sh\nnpm config get userconfig   # defaults to ~/.npmrc\nnpm config get globalconfig # defaults to /usr/local/etc/npmrc\n```\n\nUninstalling npm does not remove configuration files by default.  You\nmust remove them yourself manually if you want them gone.  Note that\nthis means that future npm installs will not remember the settings that\nyou have chosen.\n\n## More Docs\n\nCheck out the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/).\n\nYou can use the `npm help` command to read any of them.\n\nIf you\'re a developer, and you want to use npm to publish your program,\nyou should [read this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers).\n\n## BUGS\n\nWhen you find issues, please report them:\n\n* web:\n  <https://npm.community/c/bugs>\n\nBe sure to include *all* of the output from the npm command that didn\'t work\nas expected.  The `npm-debug.log` file is also helpful to provide.\n\nYou can also find npm people in `#npm` on https://package.community/ or\n[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/npm_support).  Whoever responds will no\ndoubt tell you to put the output in a gist or email.\n\n## SEE ALSO\n\n* npm(1)\n* npm-help(1)\n* npm-index(7)\n',
